# Love
<p>Love is not enough. A healthy relationship requires more than pure emotion or lofty passions. We understand that there are more important things in our lives and relationships than simply being in love. The only way to truly enjoy the love in your life is to make something else more important than the love in your life.</p>

<p>Love is not unique, it's not special, it's not scarce. But your self respect is, and so is your dignity, and so is your ability to trust people. There can be many many loves throughout your life but you only get to lose your self respect or your dignity once, and they are very hard to get back.</p>
