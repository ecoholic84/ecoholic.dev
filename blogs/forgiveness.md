# Forgiveness 

It's important to forgive, but not necessarily to be able to forget.

Eg: If I give you my baby to hold and you drop my baby, I might forgive you, maybe, but even if I do I am not probably gonna let you hold my baby again. You will be Alex, the baby dropper. 

It's wise to be able to learn from past mistakes and apply it to our future decisions including our past relationship with someone.

Learn from experience.

Someone who hurt you is often hurting themselves.
